Bee v2.7 introduces key fixes and optimizations across multiple areas, including AutoTLS in the browser for secure browser-node communication, sampling speed improvements, and decreased transaction costs.

* In-browser client AutoTLS secures communication between browser and node
* Pullsync protocol metrics for better performance monitoring 
* Improvements to erasure coding implementation 
* Fix for legacy feed handling
* Ultra-light node postage snapshot skip fix
* Transaction fee and cost optimizations
* More efficient sampling process brings shorter sampling times
* Pushsync performance fixes
